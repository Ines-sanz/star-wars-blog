### `npm install`

🚨 Unfortunately, the API that hosted the images has been deleted, so the website is not displaying as expected.  
To see how it was supposed to look, check it out [here](https://www.ines-sanz.com/fullstack/star-wars/).  
Of course, you can still check out the code and see how it was built! :)
